## Colour palette

To arrive at the colour palette I first made everything as 'proper' colour as I could,  
then inverted it.

# DevLog

## Day One

Decided on the concept.  

Doom Cricket.  

Found four pictures which bring the concept to life:  

- Viv Richards  
- Battle Chess  
- Blood Bowl  
- Hyborian Arena  

## Day Two

Looked up a tutorial on [pixel artwork](http://www.yarrninja.com/pixeltutorial/index.html).   

Made a grass tile in Aseprite.  

Made a tileset in Tiled.  

Put it on a map in Tiled.  

Exported the map as an image.  

Found some cricket icons and placed, trying to make it look like they are doing battle.    

Inverted colour palette.
