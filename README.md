## Day One

Decided on the concept.  

Doom Cricket.  

Found four pictures which bring the concept to life:  

- Viv Richards  
- Battle Chess  
- Blood Bowl  
- Hyborian Arena  

## Day Two

Looked up a tutorial on [pixel artwork](http://www.yarrninja.com/pixeltutorial/index.html).   

Made a grass tile in Aseprite.  

Made a tileset in Tiled.  

Put it on a map in Tiled.  

Exported the map as an image.
